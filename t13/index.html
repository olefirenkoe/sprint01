        <p>A superhero or superheroine is a stock character that possesses abilities beyond those of ordinary people, who typically uses his or her powers to help the world become a better place, or is dedicated to protecting the public, and stopping evil.
            Superhero fiction is the genre of fiction that is centered on such characters,[1] especially in American comic books since the 1930s (and later Hollywood films), as well as in Japanese media (including kamishibai, tokusatsu, manga, anime and
            video games) since the 1930s.

            Superheroes come from a wide array of different backgrounds and origins. Some superheroes (for example Batman and Iron Man) derive their status from advanced technology they create and use, while others (such as Superman and Spider-Man) possess non-human
            or superhuman biology or study and practice magic to achieve their abilities (such as Zatanna and Doctor Strange).[2][3][4] While the Dictionary.com definition of "superhero" is "a figure, especially in a comic strip or cartoon, endowed with
            superhuman powers and usually portrayed as fighting evil or crime",[5] the longstanding Merriam-Webster dictionary gives the definition as "a fictional hero having extraordinary or superhuman powers; also: an exceptionally skillful or successful
            person."[6] Terms such as masked crime fighters, costumed adventurers or masked vigilantes are sometimes used to refer to characters such as the Spirit, who may not be explicitly referred to as superheroes but nevertheless share similar traits.

            Some superheroes use their powers to help fight daily crime while also combating threats against humanity from supervillains, who are their criminal counterparts. Often at least one of these supervillains will be the superhero's archenemy. Some popular
            supervillains become recurring characters in their own right; and long-running superheroes and superheroines such as Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman, Spider-Man, Captain America and Iron Man have a rogues gallery of many such villains.

            The word superhero dates back to 1917.[7] Antecedents of the archetype include such mythologic characters like Gilgamesh, Hanuman, Perseus, Odysseus, David, and demigods like Heracles,[8][9] as well as folkloric heroes as Robin Hood, who adventured in
            distinctive clothing.[10] Real life inspirations behind costumed superheroes can be traced back to the "masked vigilantes" of the American Old West such as the San Diego Vigilantes[11][12] and the Bald Knobbers[13] who fought and killed outlaws
            while wearing masks.[14]

            The 1903 British play The Scarlet Pimpernel and its spinoffs popularized the idea of a masked avenger and the superhero trope of a secret identity.[10] Shortly afterward, masked and costumed pulp fiction characters such as Jimmie Dale/the Gray Seal (1914),
            Zorro (1919), Buck Rogers (1928), The Shadow (1930), Flash Gordon (1934), and comic strip heroes, such as the Phantom (1936) began appearing, as did non-costumed characters with super strength, including the comic-strip characters Patoruzú
            (1928) and Popeye (1929) and novelist Philip Wylie's character Hugo Danner (1930).[15] In August 1937, in a letter column of the pulp magazine Thrilling Wonder Stories, the word superhero was used to define the title character of the comic
            strip Zarnak by Max Plaisted.[16][17]

            In the 1930s, the trends converged in some of the earliest superpowered costumed heroes, such as Japan's Ōgon Bat (1931) and Prince of Gamma (early 1930s), who first appeared in kamishibai (a kind of hybrid media combining pictures with live storeytelling),[18][19]
            Mandrake the Magician (1934),[20][21][22] Olga Mesmer (1937)[23] and then Superman (1938) and Captain Marvel (1939) at the beginning of the Golden Age of Comic Books. The precise era of the Golden Age of Comic Books is disputed, though most
            agree that it was started with the launch of Superman in 1938.[24] Superman has remained one of the most recognizable superheroes,[24] and his success spawned a new archetype of characters with secret identities and superhuman powers.[25][26][27]
            At the end of the decade, in 1939, Batman was created by Bob Kane and Bill Finger.

            In 1971, Kamen Rider launched the "Henshin Boom" on Japanese television in the early 1970s, greatly impacting the tokusatsu superhero genre in Japan.[46] In 1972, the Science Ninja Team Gatchaman anime debuted, which built upon the superhero team idea
            of the live-action Phantom Agents as well as introducing different colors for team members and special vehicles to support them, said vehicles could also combine into a larger one. Another important event was the debut of Mazinger Z by Go
            Nagai, creating the Super Robot genre. Go Nagai also wrote the manga Cutey Honey in 1973; although the Magical Girl genre already existed, Nagai's manga introduced Transformation sequences that would become a staple of Magical Girl media.
            The 1970s would see more anti-heroes introduced into Superhero fiction such examples included the debut of Shotaro Ishinomori's Skull Man (the basis for his later Kamen Rider) in 1970, Go Nagai's Devilman in 1972 and Gerry Conway and John
            Romita's Punisher in 1974. The dark Skull Man manga would later get a television adaptation and underwent drastic changes. The character was redesigned to resemble a grasshopper, becoming the renowned first masked hero of the Kamen Rider series.
            Kamen Rider is a motorcycle riding hero in an insect-like costume, who shouts Henshin (Metamorphosis) to don his costume and gain superhuman powers. The ideas of second-wave feminism, which spread through the 1960s into the 1970s, greatly
            influenced the way comic book companies would depict as well as market their female characters: Wonder Woman was for a time revamped as a mod-dressing martial artist directly inspired by the Emma Peel character from the British television
            series The Avengers (no relation to the superhero team of the same name),[47] but later reverted to Marston's original concept after the editors of Ms. magazine publicly disapproved of the character being depowered and without her traditional
            costume;[48] Supergirl was moved from being a secondary feature on Action Comics to headline Adventure Comics in 1969; the Lady Liberators appeared in an issue of The Avengers as a group of mind-controlled superheroines led by Valkyrie (actually
            a disguised supervillainess) and were meant to be a caricatured parody of feminist activists;[49] and Jean Grey became the embodiment of a cosmic being known as the Phoenix Force with seemingly unlimited power in the late 1970s, a stark contrast
            from her depiction as the weakest member of her team a decade ago. Both major publishers began introducing new superheroines with a more distinct feminist theme as part of their origin stories or character development. Examples include Big
            Barda, Power Girl, and the Huntress by DC comics; and from Marvel, the second Black Widow, Shanna the She-Devil, and The Cat.[50] Female supporting characters who were successful professionals or hold positions of authority in their own right
            also debuted in the pages of several popular superhero titles from the late 1950s onward: Hal Jordan's love interest Carol Ferris was introduced as the Vice-President of Ferris Aircraft and later took over the company from her father; Medusa,
            who was first introduced in the Fantastic Four series, is a member of the Inhuman Royal Family and a prominent statesperson within her people's quasi-feudal society; and Carol Danvers, a decorated officer in the United States Air Force who
            would become a costumed superhero herself years later. In 1975 Shotaro Ishinomori's Himitsu Sentai Gorenger debuted on what is now TV Asahi, it brought the concepts of multi-colored teams and supporting vehicles that debuted in Gatchaman into
            live-action, and began the Super Sentai franchise (later adapted into the American Power Rangers series in the 1990s). In 1978, Toei adapted Spider-Man into a live-action Japanese television series. In this continuity, Spider-Man had a vehicle
            called Marveller that could transform into a giant and powerful robot called Leopardon, this idea would be carried over to Toei's Battle Fever J (also co-produced with Marvel) and now multi-colored teams not only had support vehicles but giant
            robots to fight giant monsters with.
