        What makes a superhero?
    </h2>
    <p>
        A superhero is a person who does heroic deeds and has the ability to do them in a way that a normal person couldn’t. So in order to be a superhero,<b>you need a power that is more
            exceptional than any power a normal human being could possess</b>, and you need to use that power to accomplish good deeds. Otherwise, a policeman or a fireman could be considered a superhero.
    </p>
    <p>
        For instance, a good guy fighting a bad guy could be just a regular police story or detective story or human-interest story. But if it’s a good guy with a superpower who is fighting a bad guy, it becomes a superhero story. If the good guy is doing something
        that a normal human being couldn’t do, couldn’t accomplish, then I assume he becomes a superhero.
